    <string name="about_us">
        We are a group of people who strived
        for home cooked food after moving to
        the metro cities. The biggest negative
        of shifting to a big city is the almost
        negligible intake of home cooked food.
        Due to this, the epiphany occurred,
        wherein the idea of Mealman dawned upon
        us. The fundamental objective is very clear
        – to deliver home cooked food at nominal
        rates. Food that your dear mom served you.
        Comfort of warm and tasty food during a
        long tiring day will leave you content.
        We make quality food under hygienic
        conditions and we add the element of
        advanced technology for you to manage your
        meals in a better way. You may register,
        cancel, add your meals through our applicaton.

        As we captioned -WE ARE APPIFIED.
